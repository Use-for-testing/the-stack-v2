# Jupyter notebooks as scripts and structured data


To filter and format Jupyter notebooks we use the same code as The Stack v1:
- For Jupyter Scripts: [here](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-dataset/blob/main/preprocessing/jupyter_script_conversion.py)
- For structured notebooks: [here](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-dataset/tree/main/preprocessing/jupyter-structured)
