# Kaggle notebooks

Here you can find the code for:
- Processing the [Meta Kaggle Code](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/meta-kaggle-code) dataset to convert notebooks into python scripts
- Downloading and retrieving some metadata on the datasets used in each notebook when available (`df.info()`, column names and 4 examples).
- Building the final kaggle samples with special tokens used for the training.
